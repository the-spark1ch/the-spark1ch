# Hi, I'm spark1ch 👋

### Software Engineer | Backend & Systems Focus

I am a **Software Engineer with 4 years of experience in Python**, specializing in backend systems, application architecture, and performance-oriented development.

My focus is not just on writing code - but on designing systems that are scalable, maintainable, and efficient. I enjoy solving algorithmic challenges, optimizing performance, and building structured solutions that remain clean over time.

I work comfortably across backend, desktop, and web environments, with a strong engineering mindset and attention to detail.
